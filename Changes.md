List of changes
===============

This is to track all the changes made, so not to forget to update the documentation accordingly once the coding is finished.

1. All methods no longer throw TypeError, they reject with it instead.

2. Methods batch, page and sequence now do not reject with a custom object/value, only with a custom error!
