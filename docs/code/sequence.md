## sequence(source, [dest], [limit], [track]) â‡’ <code>Promise</code>
**Summary**: Resolves a dynamic sequence of <a href="https://github.com/vitaly-t/spex/wiki/Mixed-Values">mixed values</a>.  

---
**Alternative Syntax:**`sequence(source, {dest, limit, track})` &#8658; `Promise`Acquires <a href="https://github.com/vitaly-t/spex/wiki/Mixed-Values">mixed values</a> from the source function, one at a time, and resolves them,till either no more values left in the sequence or an error/reject occurs.It supports both [linked and detached sequencing](../concept/sequencing.md).<img src="../images/sequence.png" width="561px" height="193px" alt="sequence">

  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
    <td>source</td><td><code>function</code></td><td></td><td><p>Expected to return the next <a href="https://github.com/vitaly-t/spex/wiki/Mixed-Values">mixed value</a> to be resolved. Returning or resolving
with <code>undefined</code> ends the sequence, and the method resolves.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> = current request index in the sequence</li>
<li><code>data</code> = resolved data from the previous call (<code>undefined</code> when <code>index=0</code>)</li>
<li><code>delay</code> = number of milliseconds since the last call (<code>undefined</code> when <code>index=0</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The function is called with the same <code>this</code> context as the calling method.</p>
<p>If the function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the sequence terminates,
and the method rejects with object <code>{index, error, source}</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> = index of the request that failed</li>
<li><code>error</code> = the error thrown or the rejection reason</li>
<li><code>source</code> = resolved <code>data</code> that was passed into the function</li>
</ul>
<p>Passing in anything other than a function will throw <code>Invalid sequence source.</code></p>
</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>[dest]</td><td><code>function</code></td><td></td><td><p>Optional destination function (notification callback), to receive resolved data for each index,
process it and respond as required.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> = index of the resolved data in the sequence</li>
<li><code>data</code> = the data resolved</li>
<li><code>delay</code> = number of milliseconds since the last call (<code>undefined</code> when <code>index=0</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The function is called with the same <code>this</code> context as the calling method.</p>
<p>It can optionally return a promise object, if data processing is done asynchronously.
If a promise is returned, the method will not request another value from the <code>source</code> function,
until the promise has been resolved.</p>
<p>If the function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the sequence terminates,
and the method rejects with object <code>{index, error, dest}</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> = index of the data that was processed</li>
<li><code>error</code> = the error thrown or the rejection reason</li>
<li><code>dest</code> = resolved data that was passed into the function</li>
</ul>
<p>Passing in a non-empty value other than a function will throw <code>Invalid sequence destination.</code></p>
</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>[limit]</td><td><code>Number</code></td><td><code>0</code></td><td><p>Limits the maximum size of the sequence. If the value is greater than 0, the method will
successfully resolve once the specified limit has been reached.</p>
<p>When <code>limit</code> isn&#39;t specified (default), the sequence is unlimited, and it will continue
till one of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>source</code> either returns or resolves with <code>undefined</code></li>
<li>either <code>source</code> or <code>dest</code> functions throw an error or return a rejected promise</li>
</ul>
</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>[track]</td><td><code>Boolean</code></td><td><code>false</code></td><td><p>Changes the type of data to be resolved by this method. By default, it is <code>false</code>
(see the return result). When set to be <code>true</code>, the method tracks/collects all resolved data
into an array internally, and resolves with that array once the method has finished successfully.</p>
<p>It must be used with caution, as to the size of the sequence, because accumulating data for
a very large sequence can result in consuming too much memory.</p>

**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> - When successful, the resolved data depends on parameter `track`. When `track` is `false`(default), the method resolves with object `{total, duration}`: - `total` = number of values resolved by the sequence - `duration` = number of milliseconds consumed by the methodWhen `track` is `true`, the method resolves with an array of all the data that has been resolved,the same way that the standard `promise.all` resolves. In addition, the array comes extended withread-only property `duration` - number of milliseconds consumed by the method.When the method fails, the reject result depends on which function caused the failure - `source`or `dest`. See the two parameters for the rejection details.
