## Linked and Detached Sequencing

#### Terminology

Elements in a *detached sequence* are created without any dependency between them.

In a *linked sequence* elements are created with one or both of the dependencies:
  
* element's index in the sequence
* previous element in the sequence

Method [sequence] supports each of the three sequence variations.
